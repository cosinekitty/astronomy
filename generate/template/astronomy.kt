 * The right ascension to be assigned to the star, expressed in J2000 equatorial coordinates (EQJ).
 * The value is in units of sidereal hours, and must be within the half-open range [0, 24).
 *
 * @param dec
 * The declination to be assigned to the star, expressed in J2000 equatorial coordinates (EQJ).

 * Information about a lunar eclipse.

 * Returned by [searchLunarEclipse] or [nextLunarEclipse]
 * to report information about a lunar eclipse event.
 * When a lunar eclipse is found, it is classified as penumbral, partial, or total.
 * Penumbral eclipses are difficult to observe, because the Moon is only slightly dimmed
 * by the Earth's penumbra; no part of the Moon touches the Earth's umbra.
 * Partial eclipses occur when part, but not all, of the Moon touches the Earth's umbra.
 * Total eclipses occur when the entire Moon passes into the Earth's umbra.
 *
 * The `kind` field thus holds `EclipseKind.Penumbral`, `EclipseKind.Partial`,
 * or `EclipseKind.Total`, depending on the kind of lunar eclipse found.
 *
 * The `obscuration` field holds a value in the range [0, 1] that indicates what fraction
 * of the Moon's apparent disc area is covered by the Earth's umbra at the eclipse's peak.
 * This indicates how dark the peak eclipse appears. For penumbral eclipses, the obscuration
 * is 0, because the Moon does not pass through the Earth's umbra. For partial eclipses,
 * the obscuration is somewhere between 0 and 1. For total lunar eclipses, the obscuration is 1.
 *
 * Field `peak` holds the date and time of the center of the eclipse, when it is at its peak.
 *
 * Fields `sdPenum`, `sdPartial`, and `sdTotal` hold the semi-duration of each phase
 * of the eclipse, which is half of the amount of time the eclipse spends in each
 * phase (expressed in minutes), or 0.0 if the eclipse never reaches that phase.
 * By converting from minutes to days, and subtracting/adding with `peak`, the caller
 * may determine the date and time of the beginning/end of each eclipse phase.

 *
 * The `kind` field thus holds `EclipseKind.Partial`, `EclipseKind.Annular`, or `EclipseKind.Total`.
 * A total eclipse is when the peak observer sees the Sun completely blocked by the Moon.
 * An annular eclipse is like a total eclipse, but the Moon is too far from the Earth's surface
 * to completely block the Sun; instead, the Sun takes on a ring-shaped appearance.
 * A partial eclipse is when the Moon blocks part of the Sun's disc, but nobody on the Earth
 * observes either a total or annular eclipse.
 *
 * If `kind` is `EclipseKind.Total` or `EclipseKind.Annular`, the `latitude` and `longitude`
 * fields give the geographic coordinates of the center of the Moon's shadow projected
 * onto the daytime side of the Earth at the instant of the eclipse's peak.
 * If `kind` has any other value, `latitude` and `longitude` are undefined and should

 * of the Sun's apparent disc area that is blocked from view by the Moon's silhouette,
 * as seen by an observer located at the geographic coordinates `latitude`, `longitude`
 * at the darkest time `peak`. The value will always be 1 for total eclipses, and less than
 * 1 for annular eclipses.
 * For partial eclipses, `obscuration` is undefined and should not be used.
 * This is because there is little practical use for an obscuration value of
 * a partial eclipse without supplying a particular observation location.
 * Developers who wish to find an obscuration value for partial solar eclipses should therefore use

 * stars by almost one degree per day).
 * This angle is called Greenwich Apparent Sidereal Time (GAST).
 * GAST is measured in sidereal hours in the half-open range [0, 24).
 * When GAST = 0, it means the prime meridian is aligned with the of-date equinox,
 * corrected at that time for precession and nutation of the Earth's axis.
 * In this context, the *equinox* is the direction in space where the Earth's
 * orbital plane (the ecliptic) intersects with the plane of the Earth's equator,
 * at the location on the Earth's orbit of the (seasonal) March equinox.
 * As the Earth rotates, GAST increases from 0 up to 24 sidereal hours,
 * then starts over at 0.
 * To convert to degrees, multiply the return value by 15.
 *
 * @param time
 * The date and time for which to find GAST.
 * As an optimization, this function caches the sidereal time value in `time`,

* Calculates spherical ecliptic geocentric position of the Moon.
*
* Given a time of observation, calculates the Moon's geocentric position

*
* The ecliptic angles are measured in "ECT": relative to the true ecliptic plane and
* equatorial plane at the specified time. This means the Earth's equator
* is corrected for precession and nutation, and the plane of the Earth's
* orbit is corrected for gradual obliquity drift.
*
* This algorithm is based on the Nautical Almanac Office's *Improved Lunar Ephemeris* of 1954,
* which in turn derives from E. W. Brown's lunar theories from the early twentieth century.
* It is adapted from Turbo Pascal code from the book
* [Astronomy on the Personal Computer](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783540672210)

 * Searches for the time when the Earth and another planet are separated by a specified angle in ecliptic longitude, as seen from the Sun.
 *
 * A relative longitude is the angle between two bodies measured in the plane of the Earth's orbit
 * (the ecliptic plane). The distance of the bodies above or below the ecliptic plane is ignored.
 * If you imagine the shadow of the body cast onto the ecliptic plane, and the angle measured around
 * that plane from one body to the other in the direction the planets orbit the Sun, you will get an
 * angle somewhere between 0 and 360 degrees. This is the relative longitude.
 *
 * Given a planet other than the Earth in `body` and a time to start the search in `startTime`,
 * this function searches for the next time that the relative longitude measured from the planet
 * to the Earth is `targetRelLon`.
 *
 * Certain astronomical events are defined in terms of relative longitude between the Earth and another planet:
 *
 * - When the relative longitude is 0 degrees, it means both planets are in the same direction from the Sun.
 *   For planets that orbit closer to the Sun (Mercury and Venus), this is known as *inferior conjunction*,
 *   a time when the other planet becomes very difficult to see because of being lost in the Sun's glare.
 *   (The only exception is in the rare event of a transit, when we see the silhouette of the planet passing
 *   between the Earth and the Sun.)
 *
 * - When the relative longitude is 0 degrees and the other planet orbits farther from the Sun,
 *   this is known as *opposition*.  Opposition is when the planet is closest to the Earth, and
 *   also when it is visible for most of the night, so it is considered the best time to observe the planet.
 *
 * - When the relative longitude is 180 degrees, it means the other planet is on the opposite side of the Sun
 *   from the Earth. This is called *superior conjunction*. Like inferior conjunction, the planet is
 *   very difficult to see from the Earth. Superior conjunction is possible for any planet other than the Earth.
 *
 * @param body
 * A planet other than the Earth. Any other body will cause an exception.
 *
 * @param targetRelativeLongitude
 * The desired relative longitude, expressed in degrees. Must be in the range [0, 360).
 *
 * @param startTime
 * The date and time at which to begin the search.
 *
 * @return
 * The time of the first relative longitude event that occurs after `startTime`.

/**
 * Searches for a time at which a function's value increases through zero.
 *
 * Certain astronomy calculations involve finding a time when an event occurs.
 * Often such events can be defined as the root of a function:
 * the time at which the function's value becomes zero.
 *
 * `search` finds the *ascending root* of a function: the time at which
 * the function's value becomes zero while having a positive slope. That is, as time increases,
 * the function transitions from a negative value, through zero at a specific moment,
 * to a positive value later. The goal of the search is to find that specific moment.
 *
 * The `func` parameter is an instance of the interface [SearchContext].
 * As an example, a caller may wish to find the moment a celestial body reaches a certain
 * ecliptic longitude. In that case, the caller might derive a class that contains
 * a [Body] member to specify the body and a `Double` to hold the target longitude.
 * It could subtract the target longitude from the actual longitude at a given time;
 * thus the difference would equal zero at the moment in time the planet reaches the
 * desired longitude.
 *
 * Every time it is called, `func.eval` returns a `Double` value or it throws an exception.
 * If `func.eval` throws an exception, the search immediately fails and the exception
 * is propagated to the caller. Otherwise, the search proceeds until it either finds
 * the ascending root or fails for some reason.
 *
 * The search calls `func.eval` repeatedly to rapidly narrow in on any ascending
 * root within the time window specified by `time1` and `time2`. The search never
 * reports a solution outside this time window.
 *
 * `search` uses a combination of bisection and quadratic interpolation
 * to minimize the number of function calls. However, it is critical that the
 * supplied time window be small enough that there cannot be more than one root
 * (ascedning or descending) within it; otherwise the search can fail.
 * Beyond that, it helps to make the time window as small as possible, ideally
 * such that the function itself resembles a smooth parabolic curve within that window.
 *
 * If an ascending root is not found, or more than one root
 * (ascending and/or descending) exists within the window `time1`..`time2`,
 * the search will return `null`.
 *
 * If the search does not converge within 20 iterations, it will throw an exception.
 *
 * @param func
 * The function for which to find the time of an ascending root.
 * See remarks above for more details.
 *
 * @param time1
 * The lower time bound of the search window.
 * See remarks above for more details.
 *
 * @param time2
 * The upper time bound of the search window.
 * See remarks above for more details.
 *
 * @param toleranceSeconds
 * Specifies an amount of time in seconds within which a bounded ascending root
 * is considered accurate enough to stop. A typical value is 1 second.
 *
 * @return
 * If successful, returns an [Time] value indicating a date and time
 * that is within `toleranceSeconds` of an ascending root.
 * If no ascending root is found, or more than one root exists in the time
 * window `time1`..`time2`, the function returns `null`.

/**
 * Searches for the next time a celestial body rises or sets as seen by an observer on the Earth.
 *
 * This function finds the next rise or set time of the Sun, Moon, or planet other than the Earth.
 * Rise time is when the body first starts to be visible above the horizon.
 * For example, sunrise is the moment that the top of the Sun first appears to peek above the horizon.
 * Set time is the moment when the body appears to vanish below the horizon.
 * Therefore, this function adjusts for the apparent angular radius of the observed body
 * (significant only for the Sun and Moon).
 *
 * This function corrects for a typical value of atmospheric refraction, which causes celestial
 * bodies to appear higher above the horizon than they would if the Earth had no atmosphere.
 * Astronomy Engine uses a correction of 34 arcminutes. Real-world refraction varies based
 * on air temperature, pressure, and humidity; such weather-based conditions are outside
 * the scope of Astronomy Engine.
 *
 * Note that rise or set may not occur in every 24 hour period.
 * For example, near the Earth's poles, there are long periods of time where
 * the Sun stays below the horizon, never rising.
 * Also, it is possible for the Moon to rise just before midnight but not set during the subsequent 24-hour day.
 * This is because the Moon sets nearly an hour later each day due to orbiting the Earth a
 * significant amount during each rotation of the Earth.
 * Therefore callers must not assume that the function will always succeed.
 *
 * @param body
 * The Sun, Moon, any planet other than the Earth,
 * or a user-defined star that was created by a call to [defineStar].
 *
 * @param observer
 * The location where observation takes place.
 *
 * @param direction
 * Either [Direction.Rise] to find a rise time or [Direction.Set] to find a set time.
 *
 * @param startTime
 * The date and time at which to start the search.
 *
 * @param limitDays
 * Limits how many days to search for a rise or set time, and defines
 * the direction in time to search. When `limitDays` is positive, the
 * search is performed into the future, after `startTime`.
 * When negative, the search is performed into the past, before `startTime`.
 * To limit a rise or set time to the same day, you can use a value of 1 day.
 * In cases where you want to find the next rise or set time no matter how far
 * in the future (for example, for an observer near the south pole), you can
 * pass in a larger value like 365.
 *
 * @param metersAboveGround
 * Usually the observer is located at ground level. Then this parameter
 * should be zero. But if the observer is significantly higher than ground
 * level, for example in an airplane, this parameter should be a positive
 * number indicating how far above the ground the observer is.
 * An exception occurs if `metersAboveGround` is negative.
 *
 * @return
 * On success, returns the date and time of the rise or set time as requested.
 * If the function returns `null`, it means the rise or set event does not occur
 * within `limitDays` days of `startTime`. This is a normal condition,
 * not an error.

/**
 * Finds the next time the center of a body reaches a given altitude.
 *
 * Finds when the center of the given body ascends or descends through a given
 * altitude angle, as seen by an observer at the specified location on the Earth.
 * By using the appropriate combination of `direction` and `altitude` parameters,
 * this function can be used to find when civil, nautical, or astronomical twilight
 * begins (dawn) or ends (dusk).
 *
 * Civil dawn begins before sunrise when the Sun ascends through 6 degrees below
 * the horizon. To find civil dawn, pass `Direction.Rise` for `direction` and -6 for `altitude`.
 *
 * Civil dusk ends after sunset when the Sun descends through 6 degrees below the horizon.
 * To find civil dusk, pass `Direction.Set` for `direction` and -6 for `altitude`.
 *
 * Nautical twilight is similar to civil twilight, only the `altitude` value should be -12 degrees.
 *
 * Astronomical twilight uses -18 degrees as the `altitude` value.
 *
 * By convention for twilight time calculations, the altitude is not corrected for
 * atmospheric refraction. This is because the target altitudes are below the horizon,
 * and refraction is not directly observable.
 *
 * `searchAltitude` is not intended to find rise/set times of a body for two reasons:
 * (1) Rise/set times of the Sun or Moon are defined by their topmost visible portion, not their centers.
 * (2) Rise/set times are affected significantly by atmospheric refraction.
 * Therefore, it is better to use [searchRiseSet] to find rise/set times, which
 * corrects for both of these considerations.
 *
 * `searchAltitude` will not work reliably for altitudes at or near the body's
 * maximum or minimum altitudes. To find the time a body reaches minimum or maximum altitude
 * angles, use [searchHourAngle].
 *
 * @param body
 * The Sun, Moon, any planet other than the Earth,
 * or a user-defined star that was created by a call to [defineStar].

 * The location where observation takes place.

 * Either [Direction.Rise] to find an ascending altitude event or [Direction.Set] to find a descending altitude event.

/**
 * Finds visual magnitude, phase angle, and other illumination information about a celestial body.
 *
 * This function calculates information about how bright a celestial body appears from the Earth,
 * reported as visual magnitude, which is a smaller (or even negative) number for brighter objects
 * and a larger number for dimmer objects.
 *
 * For bodies other than the Sun, it reports a phase angle, which is the angle in degrees between
 * the Sun and the Earth, as seen from the center of the body. Phase angle indicates what fraction
 * of the body appears illuminated as seen from the Earth. For example, when the phase angle is
 * near zero, it means the body appears "full" as seen from the Earth.  A phase angle approaching
 * 180 degrees means the body appears as a thin crescent as seen from the Earth.  A phase angle
 * of 90 degrees means the body appears "half full".
 * For the Sun, the phase angle is always reported as 0; the Sun emits light rather than reflecting it,
 * so it doesn't have a phase angle.
 *
 * When the body is Saturn, the returned structure contains a field `ringTilt` that holds
 * the tilt angle in degrees of Saturn's rings as seen from the Earth. A value of 0 means
 * the rings appear edge-on, and are thus nearly invisible from the Earth. The `ringTilt` holds
 * 0 for all bodies other than Saturn.
 *
 * @param body
 * The Sun, Moon, or any planet other than the Earth.
 *
