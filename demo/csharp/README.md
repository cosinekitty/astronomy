# Astronomy Engine examples in C#

---

### [Moon Phase Calculator](moonphase/moonphase.cs)
This example shows how to determine the Moon's current phase,
and how to predict when the next few quarter phases will occur.

### [Body Positions](positions/positions.cs)
An example of how to calculate equatorial and horizontal coordinates for all of the major solar system bodies.

### [Rise/Set](riseset/riseset.cs)
Shows how to calculate sunrise, sunset, moonrise, and moonset times.

### [Seasons](seasons/seasons.cs)
Calculates the equinoxes and solstices for a given calendar year.

### [Culmination](culminate/culminate.cs)
Finds when the Sun, Moon, and planets reach their highest position in the sky on a given date,
as seen by an observer at a specified location on the Earth.
Culmination is also the moment a body crosses the *meridian*, the imaginary semicircle
in the sky that passes from due north on the horizon, through the zenith (straight up),
and then toward due south on the horizon.

### [Horizon Intersection](horizon/horizon.cs)
This is a more advanced example. It shows how to use coordinate
transforms to find where the ecliptic intersects with an observer's
horizon at a given date and time.
